Hi, my name is Ruiman.  I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stat), studying under the supervision of Professor Paula Moraga in her Geospatial Statistics and Health Surveillance Research Group.

Before joining KAUST, I obtained my Master's Degree in Statistics (August 2020) from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. My research interests include spatial and spatial-temporal data modeling.
